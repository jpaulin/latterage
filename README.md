## Go be a Diamond!

Founder of a steamy garage startup, you are totally done with
sweating each day in and out. You want to become a Diamond!
Have traction, have pre-VC, angels, champagne and maybe
even consider retiring as a well-funded crafts beer maker?

## Gameplay

TBD

## items of interest
- founder's diary
- other personal belongings
- tech gadgets
- various PC / Mac stuff
  - make your infrastructure sync!
  - have it maintained or hire a Admin geek

## The developers

TBD

## Cash

Cash is your primary weapon. You receive cash
from finished Projects. 

Cash can be used for 
- paying vendor invoices
- expensed at Tech Fairs
- payroll 
- taxes

## The Wheel of momentum

"Learn to master the Wheel and you will soon find success
near the corner."

One of the most important things in the game UI is
the Wheel of momentum. It's a spinning wheel, which
tells you basically how energetically your company
is buzzing.

You will see periodic undulation of your momentum - hey:
life's not a walk in the park. Diamondhood certainly is not!

Momentum comes from the overall velocity you achieve
in projects. 

## What does the Wheel practically do?

You'll cave in to the matrix of business. The matrix is
a "map" of opportunities and unknown waters. You can 
direct the Wheel nudging it one turn at a time. 


## Costs

TBD

## Sales campaigns

## Getting revenue

There's 3 basic options for getting revenue:
 - the Subscriber model (SaaS)
 - ad based business model (Media)
 - Tailored product model (COTS)

You can change your Mode anytime. However, be aware that
such drastic stunt will
* set your Wheel to standstill (speed zero)
* you'll thus kind of "lose" energy
* any non-finished project will impact a -1 in Reputation stats
* any cancelled projects that have a Penalty Fee will be subtracted from Cash 

## The stats system: 

Reputation points

 tell how reliably and well you have finished your Projects.
